# CapitalNavigatorAStar
this is a program that will find the shortest path between two state capitals using the A* algorithm.

This is a program that determines the shortest path from one capital to another capital using only capitals as nodes.

In other words, If I would like to get from Bismark, North Dakota to Des Moines, Iowa, then you must go through
Pierre, South Dakota. When running the files, please ensure that the US-Capitals.geo file is contained within the same directory as the
.java files
